# UnityStandardScripts
I got too annoyed to redo all the small things. So here, collection of all time favorite small things.

Installation:

DO NOT CLONE IT DIRECTLY INTO PROJECT. Copy the folder instead!
  
  For documentation please switch to wiki page.
  
  What do we currently have:
	  
   * Object pooling system
   * Transform constraints 
   * Level system 
  
All components are made with BAREBONES KISS style in mind, so that you can build on top of it whatever you want.
